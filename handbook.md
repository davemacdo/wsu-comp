## Listening Discussions

### Introduction

Listening is important. Being able to hear a piece of music and observe (understand?) something about it is not only critical to evaluating the music of others, but your own music as well. Furthermore, expressing a relevant musical thought in your music requires at least *some* understanding of the contextâ€”the repertoire your music will contribute to. Listening critically and analytically is not easy, and it requires practice. Do not listen while doing other things. Sit down and focus as you would while reading a book or watching a movie. This will be difficult at first, but I promise that it will get easier and more rewarding as you practice it.

### Listening Discussion

Each week, you will listen to a particular work (or group of works). Listen to the work attentively several times. You may listen to any recording you like, but each prompt will provide a link to Spotify, SoundCloud, YouTube, or something similar. Occasionally, you will find an extra, optional listening suggestion for added context, or because I just like the piece.

Plan to participate actively in the discussion throughout the week on Discord.

#### Initial thoughts

*Listen to the assigned work(s) and share your initial thoughts each week before Thursday's studio class.* While there is not a specific word count for Discord discussions, I expect you to contribute meaningful and salient observations. Express your thoughts on the piece. Focus on objective statements about how the work is constructed. Consider addressing the following (not all will apply to every piece):

- What about the piece do you find interesting?
- How does the composer make use of the instruments or voice types used?
- What textures does the composer use?
- (How) does the composer create a sense of progression (moving from one point to another) in the piece?
- (How) does the composer develop motivic ideas in the piece?
- (How) does the composer create contrast?

If you like or do not like a work, you should still be able to address these issues. You don't have to like everything you listen to, and you *should* listen to things that you don't like. A thoughtful and mature musician like you should be able to listen to any piece of music and identify at least one thing that you would want to emulate in your own music *and* at least one thing you would want to write differently.

#### Continuing discussion

Stick around after you've shared your initial thoughts throughout the week to continue the conversation. There is no specific number of replies or messages you need to make; I simply expect you to remain engaged and discussing things after you share your initial thoughts. Demonstrate that you've read what other people have shared and reflected on it. I'm not here to count up each person's posts or words. Feel free to question the conclusions of other composers, but *be nice*!
