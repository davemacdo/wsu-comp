title: Upper-level portfolio review
---

Students must apply to become a composition major by submitting a portfolio after successfully completing MUSC 260. The portfolio should consist of compositions that the applicant feels represent their best and most mature work. 

## Composition Portfolio guidelines

- minimum of three and maximum of four works
- works should be written or substantially revised within the last two years
- works should be written for a variety of media (instruments and voices)
- include both scores and recordings
	- Scores (where applicable) should be bound, computer-engraved, performance-ready copies.
	- Submit scores (not parts) in both digital (PDF) and hard copy to Dr. MacDonald, either directly or in faculty mailbox.
	- Recordings of all works are required; live performance or rehearsal recordings are preferred, computer realizations are acceptable.
	- Submit digital materials by sending a public link to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or similar file-sharing service. **_Do not email files directly._** 

The deadline for submitting the portfolio will be announced to students enrolled in MUSC 260, and will usually be the study day (before exams week) of the semester before the student intends to enroll in upper-level composition coursework. 

Students are also required to meet any jury expectations on their primary instrument/voice and according to the guidelines of that area.
