# Listening Discussions

## Introduction

Listening is important. Being able to hear a piece of music and observe (understand?) something about it is not only critical to evaluating the music of others, but your own music as well. Furthermore, expressing a relevant musical thought in your music requires at least *some* understanding of the contextâ€”the repertoire your music will contribute to. Listening critically and analytically is not easy, and it requires practice. Do not listen while doing other things. Sit down and focus as you would while reading a book or watching a movie. This will be difficult at first, but I promise that it will get easier and more rewarding as you practice it.

## Listening Discussion

Each week, you will listen to a particular work (or group of works). Listen to the work attentively several times. You may listen to any recording you like, but each prompt will provide a link to Spotify, SoundCloud, YouTube, or something similar. Occasionally, you will find an extra, optional listening suggestion for added context, or because I just like the piece.

Plan to participate actively in the discussion throughout the week on Discord.

### Initial thoughts

*Listen to the assigned work(s) and share your initial thoughts each week before Thursday's studio class.* While there is not a specific word count for Discord discussions, I expect you to contribute meaningful and salient observations. Express your thoughts on the piece. Focus on objective statements about how the work is constructed. Consider addressing the following (not all will apply to every piece):

- What about the piece do you find interesting?
- How does the composer make use of the instruments or voice types used?
- What textures does the composer use?
- (How) does the composer create a sense of progression (moving from one point to another) in the piece?
- (How) does the composer develop motivic ideas in the piece?
- (How) does the composer create contrast?

If you like or do not like a work, you should still be able to address these issues. You don't have to like everything you listen to, and you *should* listen to things that you don't like. A thoughtful and mature musician like you should be able to listen to any piece of music and identify at least one thing that you would want to emulate in your own music *and* at least one thing you would want to write differently.

### Continuing discussion

Stick around after you've shared your initial thoughts throughout the week to continue the conversation. There is no specific number of replies or messages you need to make; I simply expect you to remain engaged and discussing things after you share your initial thoughts. Demonstrate that you've read what other people have shared and reflected on it. I'm not here to count up each person's posts or words. Feel free to question the conclusions of other composers, but *be nice*!

# Composition Studio Recital Guide

## Overview

Composition recitals are a fantastic opportunity for several reasons.

- Hear your music performed by real people, and not the robots that live in your computer.
- Work directly with performers to make your scores and parts clearer and your music more playable.
- Share the results of your hard work and creativity with the department.
- Get an excellent grade in lessons by meeting the performance requirement. (See lesson syllabus for details.)
- Add to your portfolio of recordings.
- Have fun.

All composition studio members are eligible to present works on composition recitals. Other music majors working on composition may be included if time permits.

## Program Submission

**Six weeks before** the date of the performance, please submit the following information to Dr. MacDonald. A link to a submission form will be sent via email.

- Your name
- Title of your work
- Instrumentation
- Approximate duration
- Performers' names and instruments/voice types
- Program note

**Two weeks before** the date of the performance, please submit a rehearsal recording of your piece to Dr. MacDonald. It doesn't have to be fancy. A recording from your phone is fine. *Failure to submit this recording will result in your piece being pulled from the program.*

"Rehearsal recording" doesn't mean that it needs to be ready to perform, but it should demonstrate that you are well on your way to a good performance. This should *not* be a sight-read. Players on this recording should be the same as will appear on the performance.

## Working With Performers

- **Start early.** Get commitments from your performers as early as possible. The best situation is to start working with performers from the minute you start composing the piece. Start rehearsals as early as possible. Get scores and parts to your performers five to six weeks before the concert, and start rehearsals about four weeks before the concert.
- **Be professional.** Give your performers as much respect as you would give any professional, even though they may be your friends. Give them the sharpest, most polished performance materials possible. Attend rehearsals whenever possible. Give specific, useful feedback.
- **Don't grovel.** When approaching performers, don't just ask them to play your music; ask them to collaborate with you. There is a difference between "Will you please practice this eight-minute piece, attend four rehearsals, and give a performance?" and "I would really like to collaborate with you. Would you like to work with me on this piece?" Help them feel ownership over the project and privileged to be a part of bringing to life a *brand new piece of music that nobody has ever heard before!*
- **Say "thank you."** It may be obvious, but just saying thank you means a lot. You aren't expected to pay your performers for this sort of curricular recital, but saying thank you and maybe buying them a coffee wouldn't go amiss.
